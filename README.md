## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn-ui
- Web Share API
- html2pdf.js (PDF export)
- Mammoth.js, pdfjs-dist (resume file parsing)

**Backend & Integrations:**
- n8n (workflow automation, webhook handling)
- Cohere AI (LLM for resume refinement, via trial API keys)
- Supabase (authentication, magic link, database)

**Other Tools:**
- Postman (API and workflow testing)

## üìù How It Works

1. **Authentication:**
   - User enters their email and receives a magic link via Supabase.
   - Clicking the link grants access to the dashboard.

2. **Resume Tailoring:**
   - User provides their current resume and the job description.
   - Optionally, upload a resume file (PDF, Word, TXT).
   - Data is sent to n8n via webhook, which:
     - Formats the input in a code node.
     - Sends it to Cohere AI via HTTP request node with a refined prompt.
     - Receives the tailored resume from Cohere, formats it, and returns it as JSON.
   - The tailored resume is displayed in the frontend.

3. **Resume Management:**
   - User can download the tailored resume as PDF, copy it, or share via Web Share API.
   - All tailored resumes are saved in history, where users can view, delete, or download them.
